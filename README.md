Connect Four

Technologies used:
1. for loops and while loops
2. HTML for creation of game board
3. Jquery for DOM manipulation of individual circles

Approach taken:
1. Created 2 variations of the game - 1. Vs Player 2. Vs Computer
2. Each circle is uniquely defined with ID
3. This ensures that each circle can be configured to allow the isValid function/ checkWin function to loop through successfully
4. For Vs computer, the logic is to generate numbers which will be used to identify the circles which fulfills the condition.

Unsolved problems:
To further improve the logic of computer moves by exploring AI, current moves are random and do not block player from winning.
