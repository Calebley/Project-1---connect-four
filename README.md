Technologies used:
Predominantly for loops
HTML for creation of game board
Jquery for DOM manipulation of individual circles

Approach taken:
Each circle is uniquely defined with ID
This ensures that each circle can be configured to allow the isValid function/ checkWin function to loop through successfully
