Technologies used:
Predominantly for loops
HTML for creation of game board
Jquery for DOM manipulation of individual circles

Approach taken:
Created 2 variations of the game - 1. Vs Player 2. Vs Computer
Each circle is uniquely defined with ID
This ensures that each circle can be configured to allow the isValid function/ checkWin function to loop through successfully

Unsolved problems:
To further improve the logic of computer moves, current moves are random and do not block player from winning
